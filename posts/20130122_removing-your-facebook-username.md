description: How I managed to get facebook to remove my username and revert to profile ID
--- 

Facebook these days encourages everybody to pick a username for their account,
something which back in the day I thought was a great idea and decided to snap
up my `firstname.lastname` before somebody else. A few years later and
questionable decisions by the facebook platform led to regret,
I would begin using a pseudonym and use the site less
but as there is
no policy for deleting your username I wanted to hide without
having to create a new account.

I then sent off an
email to facebook support from an obscure contact form. I had to dig around in
the Help section but eventually found a [Questions About
Usernames](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/360358877344441?rdrhc) contact
form.

I sent it off and waited, essentially reporting my own username.
Eventually I got a reply but it was not what I wanted:

>Thanks for bringing this to our attention. It appears that the user has
>a legitimate basis for selecting the username. If you believe this is
>incorrect, we recommend that you contact the user directly to address this
>issue.

Fair enough, I thought. It doesn't seem right that they would just take down
a username without reason, but I tried again:

>I am the user with that username, but I'd like the username removed and I
>don't see the option to do this.

I braced myself for a fight, but moments later I heard back:

>Thank you for your report. We have removed the reported username for violating
>our policies. It is now available on a first-come, first-served basis, and you
>may be able to claim it by visiting https://www.facebook.com/username.

Success! Your milage may vary.

*(For what it's worth my next course of action was going to be to change my username
to a domain I owned, then email them from that domain asking the name to be
flagged)*
